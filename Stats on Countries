#In this SQL code, I'm querying a database that's holding data on countries to answer questions about the data. 


Which country has the highest density per square kilometer?
select name, max(density_per_sq_km) from countries;

Which country has the highest amount of net migrants?
select name, max(net_migrants) from countries;

Rounded to the nearest percent, what is the average percent of change in population over one year?
select round(avg(percent_one_year_change)) from countries;

Over the last year, which countries grew the most? Display based on the percentage of population change being above average and a positive net number of migrants.
select name, percent_one_year_change from countries where percent_one_year_change > 1 and net_migrants > 0
order by percent_one_year_change;

Rank all of the countries at below, average, or above based on population density per square mile.

select name, density_per_sq_km,
    case
        when density_per_sq_km <200 then "Below Average"
        when density_per_sq_km < 500 then "Average"
        when density_per_sq_km > 500 then "Above Average"
    end as "density_rating"
from countries
group by density_per_sq_km;
